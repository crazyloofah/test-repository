      <h1>Who is Matt Nichols?</h1>
      <p style="padding-left: 22px; padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large;">So you clicked on the 'about' button, huh? Wise(maybe not wise) choice. For over hundreds of years(that's false), Matt has been an astonishingly cool factotum of a man(that's not false.) You may know him from his work at PDXCodeGuild, but he can also be accredited with having a few hobbies of his own, one of them is being sarcastic.. oh, and being extremely humble too, IF you consider that a hobby.</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 22px; padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large;"> Matt competed in gymnastics his entire life growing up. You could say it was one of his passions in life. The dull light inside his soul could blind a person when it came to gymnsatics. </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 22px; padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large;">Also, he enjoys rock climbing (he finally hit a V10) when he has nothing else going on. </p>
      <p style="padding-left: 22px; padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large;">Reading is a big one too! Matt highly recommends you read the 'The Way of Kings' series if you enjoy fiction and fantasy</p>
      <p style="padding-left: 22px; padding: 30px; font-size: xx-large; color: gold;">Though ALL of this information is true, This is mostly filler info for now. I plan on making this significantly more legible and professional.</p>
